  <p>
    In my architecture design, I chose to review ResourceWatch.org. 
  Through the developer tools of google chrome, I looked through their source, network, and console to find a variety of databases, frameworks, and API’s utilized to run the site. 
  Through the console, I found the site is hosted through Amazon AWS S3. 
    
    The website utilizes a variety of spatial applications found through their network and sources requests in the console. 
  These applications include google earth engine, google maps api, mapbox api, resource watch api, and carto db. 
  Each is utilized pending the map chosen by the user, and the requests utilized when the user selects to view the particular spatial application. 
  The application is designed using webpack js, jQuery, and leaflet. These JavaScript libraries allow for versatile and functional web applications. 
  Databases include MySQL and postgres which store the majority of data requested by the applications within Resource Watch’s Web Maps.
